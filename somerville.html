<h1>Somerville</h1>

<p class="big">
    Our wedding isn't the only great thing happening in Somerville the weekend
    of the 21st! Here are some of our favorite places in the neighborhood:
</p>

<div class="details">
<h3>Marshmallow fluff</h3>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.flufffestival.com/">FluffFest</a>: just by luck,
    you'll be in town for the annual celebration of our most famous local
    confectionary spread.</li>
</ul>

<h3>All your earthly needs</h3>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.bowmarketsomerville.com/">Bow Market</a>: a
    community hub featuring small local chefs, crafts, and drinks. We have
    coffee here most Saturdays.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/cicadacoffeebar/?hl=en">Cicada</a>:
    it's a caf&eacute;! A wine bar! A Vietnamese noodle and sandwich shop! Also
    check out their sister restaurant (The Eaves) and rooftop bar (Saigon
    Babylon).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Casual eating</h3>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://highlandkitchen.com/">Highland Kitchen</a>: Just up the
    hill from our house&mdash;Southern / Caribbean food (get the goat stew!) and
    good cocktails.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.muquecarestaurant.com/">Muqueca</a>: our favorite
    Brazilian restaurant&mdash;order the seafood stew Bahia-style with coconut
    milk and palm oil.</li>
    <li><a href="https://cambridgecommonrestaurant.com/">Cambridge Common</a>:
    pub where we had our first date! (It was 2021, so we sat in a tent in the
    parking lot in 40-degree weather.) Don't get confused by the park with the
    same name (also worth a visit).</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.felipesboston.com/">Felipe's</a>: Mexican staple in
    Harvard square with a great rooftop. Narrowly lost out to the Armory as our
    wedding venue.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.lifealive.com/">Life Alive</a>:
    Local chain with grain bowls and drinks in colors you didn't know were safe
    for human consumption.</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Fine dining</h3>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.laroyalcambridge.com/">La Royal</a>: Order ceviche
    and a Pisco martini.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.giuliarestaurant.com/">Giulia</a>: a standout in a
    crowded field of Italian restaurants&mdash;known for their pasta</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.julietsomerville.com/">Juliet</a>: a frequent date
    night spot. Caf&eacute; food from the south of France&mdash;we love the
    mussels and the aioli garni.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.pammyscambridge.com/">Pammy's</a>: our special
    occasion restaurant. Italian-ish; everything is good.</li> 
    <li><a href="https://www.spokewinebar.com/">Spoke</a>: one of the most
    memorable parts of our spring break trip to Italy was a winery tour from <a
    href="https://louisdressner.com/articles/a-video-interview-with-dora-forsoni-of-poderi-sanguineto">Dora
    Forsoni</a> (presented entirely in Italian and translated by our cab
    driver). When we got home, we were amazed to see Dora's portrait hanging in
    the window at Spoke.  It bills itself as a wine bar but the food is just as
    good (don't miss the sunchoke donuts).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Drinking</h3>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.zuzuspetalscambridge.com/">Zuzu's Petals</a>:
    another regular in the date night rotation: small, quirky but reliably great
    set of wines and desserts.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.backbarunion.com/">backbar</a>: speaking of
    quirky&mdash;rated one of the best cocktail bars in America; don't be
    surprised if the menu takes the form of a comic book or a piece of Star Wars
    fan fiction. Or just ask the bartenders to make something up.</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.rebelrebelsomerville.com/">Rebel Rebel</a>: do
    you ever find yourself with a hankering for a small-batch natural orange
    wine fermented underground in a clay pot in Tbilisi, served to you by a
    gender-non-conforming sommelier who's just finishing up a Ph.D. in
    English? Or do you maybe just want a glass of wine? Either way, Rebel
    Rebel is for you.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.aeronautbrewing.com/">Aeronaut</a>: Beloved local
    craft brewer / beer garden; a great place to sit with a book on a sunny
    afternoon. Known for their IPAs, but they've been doing some killer lagers
    recently. Also home to <a
    href="https://www.carolicious.net/">Carolicious</a>, which makes excellent
    arepas.</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Coffee</h3>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.forgebakingco.com/">Forge</a>: our neighborhood
    spot (and maker of our favorite granola). If you've ever wondered just how 
    much butter goes into a croissant, grab a seat by the bakery window in the
    back.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.broadsheetcoffee.com/">Broadsheet</a>: nearby
    coffee shop and roaster, perfect for a mid-day coffee break between
    experiments at the Harvard Biolabs. One of the best almond croissants Zuri
    has ever had (and she has had many).</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.barismo.com/">Barismo</a>: Jacob's favorite
    Boston-area roaster.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Strolling and people-watching</h3>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_River_Esplanade">The
    Esplanade</a>: Park that stretches all the way along the river in Boston;
    great for runs, walks and picnics.</li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerville_Community_Path">The
    Somerville Community Path</a>: we took our engagement photos here! See all
    of Somerville out for a stroll on weekend mornings.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Art and entertainment</h3>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.gardnermuseum.org/">The Gardner</a>: weird
    little treasure-box of a museum in which every painting remains exactly
    where the founder hug it during her lifetime. Site of one of one of the
    most famous 20th-century art heists. Lots of great John Singer Sargent
    drawings and watercolors, one extraordinary Rembrandt, and a little bit
    of everything else.</li>

    <li><a href="https://www.icaboston.org/">Institute for Contemporary
    Art</a>: Boston's modern art museum. Tiny (just one little floor of
    galleries) but there's always something memorable. Also a great place
    to watch super-villains cruise through Boston Harbor in their
    mega-yachts. Bonus: the museum cafe is run by Rebel Rebel.</li>

    <li>The <a
    href="https://www.nps.gov/boaf/virtual-black-heritage-trail-tour.htm">Black
    Heritage Trail</a> and <a
    href="https://www.thefreedomtrail.org/">Freedom Trail</a>: two
    walking tours of historic Boston: a great way to see important sites
    from the American revolution and explore neighborhoods near downtown.</li>

    <li><a href="https://www.lilypadinman.com/">The Lilypad</a> and <a
    href="https://www.passim.org/live-music/">Club Passim</a>: local spots
    for live music.</li>
</ul>
