    We're excited to bring together friends and family from many different
    backgrounds&mdash;we hope that everyone experiences something new! Here's a
    little about what to expect:
</p>

<p class="details white">
    Before the ceremony, we will sign a <b>ketubah</b> (a
    Jewish marriage contract) in the presence of witnesses. The ketubah will be
    on display during the reception.
</p>

<p class="details white">
    The ceremony will take place under a <b>chuppah</b> (a wedding canopy) held
    by our friends and family. The roof of our ketubah will be made of a pair of
    quilts created by our grandmothers.
